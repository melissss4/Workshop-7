# Workshop-7

Notes from workshop:
“An object is like a container”
Can contain functions. It is a way to organise code.

Objective:
Build a simulation of a real or imagined entity or environment.
Experiment with random walks and/or particle systems in your sketch.


Current sketch:


Watching this workshop I really liked how the movement of the objects were a little bit like a computer mouse painting. I wondered if this would make an interesting background. I wanted to merge this with my previous workshop task and make this the background of my poem generator. 
While merging these two projects I did not know if I would be able to keep the slider change background function and have the objects moving in the background at the same time. However, after reading through the P5.js library I realised that these functions would not affect each other at all.
I added back in the slider functions, and was able to change the background that the walkers were on. 

Of course I would like to give credit to David who I forked the previous workshop from his week 4 workshop.
